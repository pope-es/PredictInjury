# Project Title
PredictInjury - Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
Use a simple linear regression model to predict a person's probability of suffering an injury (in bones, muscles...) over a period of time (say, next 12 months), based on different variables such as:
- Age
- Physical condition: weight, constitution.
- Physical activity routine
- History of past injuries
- Variations of these factors over recent years

## Background
As we grow old, our physical condition obviously changes, and whereas in the past we may have perceived ourselves as super healthy, in a short time span we may end up suffering the consequences of growing older and having a less resilient body.
I was personally affected by these circumstances, suffering two issues in my legs in a short period of time after a whole life without issues.

## How is it used?
There are at least two different ways in which the project could be used.

Either doctors could use it with their patients, to make them aware of their likelihood to be injured - possibly this could result in countermeasures such as workouts to improve their physical form.

Or users could be encouraged to enter their data themselves and see their results.

## Data sources and AI methods
Getting training data for this project could be tricky.

First we should review various sources of available data, to see if something similar to what we need already exists.

If nothing usable exists, then we should:
1. Establish a definite set of parameters.
2. Write questions to gather these parameters.
3. Evaluate the patients after a given time period, and note whether or not they had an injury in the X months following their answers.

## Challenges
Get enough training data.

## What next?
